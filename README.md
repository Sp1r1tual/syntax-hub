## About the Project

SyntaxHub was created in response to the need of students and beginners in programming to access information in a structured and interactive way. The platform combines educational courses with practical exercises and explanations, drawing inspiration from resources like [JavaScript.info](https://uk.javascript.info/)

The project has served as a testing ground for experimenting with UX/UI design, interactive components, and a content management system for learning. Its goal is to create a flexible tool that allows users to learn quickly, test their knowledge, and revisit material without losing context.
